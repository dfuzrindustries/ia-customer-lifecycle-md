## Purpose

The M2 Opportunity Shaping Meeting transforms a qualified opportunity into a co-created solution. This is not a pitch—it's a collaborative design session where both sides shape the approach together.

By the end of 90 minutes, you will have identified the buying committee, confirmed top priorities, explored 2-3 solution approaches together, and earned permission to write a formal proposal for M3.
