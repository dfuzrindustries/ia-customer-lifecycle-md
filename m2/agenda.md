# M2: Opportunity Shaping Meeting


**Explore Solutions Together — Collaborate, Shape, Refine**

---

**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**% Complete After M2:** 50%  
**Objective:** Co-create solution approach and earn permission to propose

---

## M2 Purpose

The M2 Opportunity Shaping Meeting takes what we learned in M1 and explores solution possibilities together. This is not a sales presentation—it's a collaborative design session where we shape the right approach as partners.

We'll present 2-3 possible solution approaches based on your priorities, get your input and reactions, and refine the direction together. By the end, we'll know exactly what to propose in M3.

---

## ✓ Success Criteria

- **Client actively engaged** — You're contributing ideas and asking questions
- **Buying committee identified** — We know who needs to approve this
- **Top 3 priorities confirmed** — Final ranking and validation
- **Solution approach co-created** — We've shaped this together
- **M3 scheduled** — Proposal review meeting locked
- **Permission granted** — You've asked us to put this in writing

### Part 4: GET PERMISSION FOR M3 (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Confirm we should write a proposal, schedule review meeting

**The Ask:**

> "This has been a powerful meeting. I love the interaction and based on everything we've discussed—[recap their goals and priorities]—I'm excited about putting this on paper in a formal proposal and SOW.
>
> If we have any questions as we're writing it, may I follow up with you? And can we schedule M3 to review the proposal together?"

**What This Does:**
- Gets permission without pressure (soft close)
- Sets up M3 for proposal review
- Opens communication for questions
- Confirms both sides are committed

**We'll Confirm:**
- M3 date/time (within 5 days)

## M2 Success Mantras

> "We're not here to tell you what you need. We're here to shape a solution together. You know your business, we know our craft. Let's collaborate to create something that works."

**End Goal:** Walk out with a clear, co-created solution approach and permission to write a winning proposal.

**We Say:**
- "What do you think about..."
- "How would you adapt this to fit..."
- "Help us understand..."
- "What would work better for you?"

**We Don't Say:**
- "This is the solution you need..."
- "Trust us, this is the right way..."
- "We've done this exact thing before..."
- "You should definitely..."
