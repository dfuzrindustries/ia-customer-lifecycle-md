- Get buy-in for approach

#### Script & Activities

**Opening (2 min)**

Script:
> "Thanks for making time today. Before we dive in, I want to recap what we heard in M1 and set expectations for today."

**Recap (5 min)**

Script:
> "Here's what stood out from our conversation:
> - You're trying to achieve [X based on M1]
> - Your top priorities are [Y, Z based on M1]
> - Success looks like [outcomes they described]
>
> Did we capture that accurately? Anything to add or adjust?"

**Frame Today (3 min)**

Script:
> "Today is about exploration and collaboration. We've developed some solution possibilities based on what you shared, but we need your input to shape the right approach.
>
> This isn't a pitch—think of it as a working session where we design this together. Sound good?"

#### Critical Success Indicator

Are they nodding and engaged? If yes, proceed.
If they seem confused or hesitant, pause and clarify.

### Part 2: Present Solution Possibilities (10-30 min)

Share thinking, invite reactions, open dialogue.

#### Objectives

- Present 2-3 solution approaches (high-level)
- Pique interest and invite questions
- Set up for collaborative refinement
- Avoid "selling" or being prescriptive

#### Presentation Structure

**1. The Challenge (3 min)**

Cover:
- Problem statement as we understand it
- Why it matters to their business
- Cost of inaction

Keep it tight. They already know the problem.

**2. Our Point of View (5 min)**

Share:
- How we think about this type of challenge
- What we've seen work (and not work) elsewhere
- Critical success factors

This is where you establish thought leadership without pitching.

**3. Solution Possibilities (10 min)**

Present 2-3 approaches:

**Approach A: [Name it descriptively]**
- Overview (2-3 bullets)
- Key components
- Benefits and trade-offs

**Approach B: [Name it descriptively]**
- Overview (2-3 bullets)
- Key components
- Benefits and trade-offs

**Approach C: [Optional]**
- Overview (2-3 bullets)
- Key components
- Benefits and trade-offs

**Comparison slide:**
- Side-by-side of trade-offs
- "We're not recommending one yet—we need your input"

**4. Questions We Need Answered (2 min)**

Share:
- Open questions for collaboration
- Areas where we need their input

#### Presentation Tips

- **Pause frequently** — Invite reactions after each approach
- **Encourage questions** — "What questions does this raise?"
- **Stay flexible** — Be ready to adapt based on their reactions
- **Don't oversell** — This is exploration, not closing

#### Critical Success Indicator

**Are they asking questions and reacting?**

If yes → They're engaged, good sign
If no → You're talking too much; pause and ask: "What are your initial thoughts?"

#### RACI Matrix

| Activity | Business Lead | EM | SME |
|---|---|---|---|
| Present Challenge | A/R | C | C |
| Present POV | R | C | R |
| Present Solutions | R | R | A |

- "What's your internal process from here?"
- "Who will champion this internally?"

Listen for:
- Names and titles of buying committee

- Hard requirements vs. nice-to-haves
- What they'd sacrifice if budget constrained

**ON PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE (5 min)**

Questions:
- "You mentioned you've worked with [vendor] before..."
- "What did you like about how they worked?"
- "What would you want us to do differently?"
- "What did you wish they had done?"

Listen for:

- Red flags to avoid

**ON SUCCESS (10 min)**

Questions:
- "How will you measure success internally?"

**What to capture:**
- Buying committee (names, titles, roles)
- Final top 3 priorities (ranked)
- Non-negotiables
- Success metrics (specific)
- Concerns raised
- Previous vendor lessons
- Any "Aha!" moments or strong reactions

### Part 4: Get Permission for M3 (80-90 min)

Soft close to earn permission to write proposal.

#### Objectives

- Confirm shaped approach
- Get permission to formalize in proposal
- Schedule M3 for proposal review
- Set expectations for proposal delivery

#### The Soft Close Script

> "This has been a powerful meeting. I love the interaction and based on everything we've discussed—[recap their goals and priorities from THIS meeting]—I'm excited about putting this on paper in a formal proposal and SOW.
>
> Here's what I'd like to propose as next steps:
> 1. We'll take what we shaped today and formalize it in a proposal
> 2. If we have any questions as we're writing it, may I follow up with you?
> 3. Can we schedule M3 in the next week to review the proposal together?
>
> Does [specific date/time] work for M3?"

**Why This Works:**
- Recaps what THEY said (not what we want)
- Asks permission (soft close, not assumptive)
- Sets specific next steps
- Proposes date/time (makes it real)

#### If They Say Yes

**Confirm:**
1. M3 date/time locked
2. Who will attend M3 (buying committee members?)
3. Who we can contact with questions during proposal writing
4. Any additional information we need
5. Confirm: "We'll send the proposal 24-48 hours before M3 so you have time to review"

#### If They Hesitate

**Option A: "I need to check with [decision maker]"**

Response:
> "Of course. Should we include [decision maker] in M3? Or would it help to have a quick call with them before we write the proposal?"

**Option B: "I'm still not sure about [X]"**

Response:
> "Let's address that now. What additional information would help?"

*Address concern, then try soft close again.*

**Option C: "This feels like a lot / too expensive"**

Response:
> "I hear you. Would it help to phase this differently? We could start with [Phase 1] to prove value, then expand?"

*Explore options, document, confirm M3 to review alternatives.*

#### RACI Matrix

| Activity | Business Lead | EM | SME |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soft Close | A/R | C | - |
| M3 Scheduling | A/R | I | - |
| Address Concerns | A/R | R | R |

## Common M2 Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake #1: Pitching, Not Collaborating

**Problem:** Coming with THE solution, not possibilities

**Fix:** Present 2-3 approaches, ask which resonates, shape together

---

### Mistake #2: Not Bringing the Team

**Problem:** BL goes solo, EM and SME don't attend

**Fix:** EM and SMEs MUST attend M2. Non-negotiable.

---

### Mistake #3: Talking Too Much (Again)

**Problem:** Presenting for 60 minutes, collaborating for 10

**Fix:** Present for 20 min max, collaborate for 50+ min

---

### Mistake #4: Not Identifying Buying Committee

**Problem:** Assuming one person decides

**Fix:** Always ask "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"

---

### Mistake #5: Skipping "What Matters Most"

**Problem:** Not reconfirming priorities from M1

**Fix:** Explicitly ask "Of everything, what are the top 3 things that matter MOST?"

---

### Mistake #6: No Clear Next Steps

**Problem:** Good meeting, but no M3 scheduled

**Fix:** ALWAYS secure M3 before leaving M2

---

### Mistake #7: Not Writing Proposal Immediately

**Problem:** Waiting days/weeks to write proposal, momentum dies

**Fix:** Strategy-to-Win within 24 hours, proposal written within 5 days

---

### Mistake #8: Skipping Strategy-to-Win

**Problem:** Winging the proposal, inconsistent messaging

**Fix:** Mandatory 90-min S2W meeting with full team

---

## M2 Success Metrics

### You've had a successful M2 if:

✅ **Client is actively engaged** and contributing ideas  
✅ **Buying committee is identified** (names, roles)  
✅ **Top 3 priorities confirmed** and ranked  
✅ **Previous vendor lessons** understood  
✅ **Solution approach co-created** (not just presented)  
✅ **M3 is scheduled** with decision makers  
✅ **Permission granted** to write the proposal  
✅ **Internal team knows** exactly what to propose  
✅ **Win themes identified** for this specific client  

### Red Flags (Proceed with Caution)

❌ Low engagement in M2 (not asking questions)  
❌ Can't identify decision maker or buying committee  
❌ Major scope or budget concerns unresolved  
❌ Conflicting priorities among stakeholders  
❌ No urgency or timeline shifting  
❌ "Let us think about it" without M3 commitment

**The Goal:** Walk out with a co-created solution and permission to write a winning proposal.

**The Mindset:** Collaborative exploration, adaptive thinking, genuine partnership.

**The Outcome:** A clear proposal direction that the client helped create (and will therefore buy into).
