# PILOT: 60-Day Roadmap
**Production Pilot — Deploy, Optimize, Scale**

---

**Duration:** 60 days  
**Investment:** $150,000  
**Objective:** Production deployment with measured impact  

---

## Pilot Purpose

The 60-day Pilot phase moves validated POCs from prototype to production. This is the transition from "proof it works" to "prove the business value." By the end of 60 days, your solutions will be running in production, users will be trained and actively using them, and you'll have quantified, measurable ROI.

This phase establishes the foundation for enterprise-wide scaling in Year 1. We're not just deploying technology—we're building operational playbooks, change management processes, and the organizational muscle memory required for sustained transformation.

## ✓ Success Criteria

- Production deploymentcomplete with all validated POCs live and operational
- User adoption ≥ 70%of target user base actively using solutions weekly
- Measurable ROIdemonstrated: time savings, cost reduction, or revenue impact quantified
- Operational playbooksdocumented for all workflows
- Support infrastructurein place with SLAs and escalation paths
- Year 1 readinessconfirmed: technical foundation and organizational readiness for scale

**Focus: Performance Tuning & Broader User Adoption**

Refine solutions based on real-world usage; expand to majority of target user base.

- Days 21-23:Performance analysis; identify optimization opportunities; prioritize enhancements
- Days 24-27:Implement refinements; improve response times; enhance UX based on feedback; add quick-win features
- Days 28-30:Expanded user training (rollout to 60-80% of target audience); updated documentation; communication campaign
- Days 31-36:Broader deployment; usage monitoring and analysis; proactive outreach to inactive users
- Days 37-40:Phase 2 assessment; measure adoption and satisfaction; refine support processes

Deliverable:60-80% user adoption; optimized performance; comprehensive support documentation; measurable efficiency gains

**Focus: Full Deployment & Business Impact Quantification**

Complete rollout to all users; measure and document ROI; prepare for Year 1 transformation program.

- Days 41-43:Final user cohort training; complete documentation; knowledge base publishing
- Days 44-48:Full deployment to 100% of target users; monitor for issues; celebrate wins with teams
- Days 49-52:ROI analysis and measurement; compare baseline to current state; quantify time savings, cost reduction, quality improvement
- Days 53-55:Operational playbook finalization; support handoff planning; sustainability planning
- Days 56-58:Executive presentation preparation; Year 1 transformation roadmap; success stories documentation
- Days 59-60:Executive readout; Pilot completion celebration; Year 1 kickoff planning

Deliverable:100% deployment; proven ROI documented; operational playbooks; Year 1 transformation roadmap; executive presentation

## Target ROI Metrics

- ≥30% time savings per user on target workflows
- ≥50% error reduction in automated tasks
- ≥70% user adoption (active weekly users)
- ≥80% user satisfaction (CSAT score)
- Payback period ≤12 months
