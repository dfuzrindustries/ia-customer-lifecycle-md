If a baseline cannot be established, the workflow cannot advance.

\#\# Step 3.5: Assess System-Level Impact

Before forming the economic impact hypothesis, practitioners must assess how the workflow interacts with the broader organization.

This step prevents local optimization and ensures enterprise value.

\---

\#\#\# System Mapping

Identify:  
\- \*\*Upstream workflows\*\* that supply inputs  
\- \*\*Downstream workflows\*\* that consume outputs  
\- \*\*Parallel workflows\*\* affected by timing or data changes  
\- \*\*Shared resources\*\* impacted (people, data, systems)

This creates a simple workflow interaction map.

\---

\#\#\# System Impact Assessment

For each affected area, assess:  
\- Will this workflow reduce or increase coordination effort?  
\- Will it shift work or bottlenecks elsewhere?  
\- Will it improve decision quality across functions?  
\- Will it alter incentives or performance measures?

\---

\#\#\# System Impact Rating (Required)

Each workflow must receive a rating:

\- \*\*Positive:\*\* Improves performance across multiple workflows or functions  
\- \*\*Neutral:\*\* Local improvement with minimal system effect  
\- \*\*Negative:\*\* Creates friction or degradation elsewhere

Workflows with negative system impact cannot advance without redesign.

\---

\#\#\# Enterprise Goal Alignment

Explicitly document:  
\- Which enterprise goals this workflow supports  
\- How its outcomes roll up to executive-level metrics

\---

\#\# Step 4: Form the Economic Impact Hypothesis

Define how the workflow will create value.

Impact types:  
\- \*\*Efficiency:\*\* Time or cost reduction  
\- \*\*Growth:\*\* Revenue increase or acceleration  
\- \*\*Risk:\*\* Loss avoidance or compliance improvement

Example:  
\> “Automating this workflow will reduce cycle time by 40%, saving \~1,200 hours annually and \~$180K in fully loaded cost.”

Hypotheses must be testable and falsifiable.

\---

\#\# Step 5: Design the Target Workflow

Design the future-state workflow:  
\- Which decisions are AI-assisted?  
\- Which actions are automated?  
\- Where humans remain accountable?

Explicitly define:  
\- Human–agent interaction  
\- Escalation paths  
\- Governance points

\---

\#\# Step 6: Select KPIs & Measurement Method

Each workflow must define:  
\- Primary economic KPIs  
\- Supporting operational KPIs  
\- Measurement cadence

Required KPIs:  
\- Dollars saved or earned  
\- Time-to-value  
\- Adoption rate

\---

\#\# Step 7: Validate in POC / Pilot

During POC and Pilot:  
\- Compare results to baseline  
\- Track variance  
\- Capture qualitative feedback  
\- Validate adoption with real users

Economic impact must be demonstrated with real data.

\---

\#\# Step 8: Verify & Report Impact

Impact is verified when:  
\- Measured against baseline  
\- Sustained over a defined period  
\- Approved by the workflow owner

Verified impact is reported to:  
\- Roadmap  
\- Scorecard  
\- Executive stakeholders

\---

\#\# Step 9: Graduate or Retire

Using graduation criteria:  
\- Advance successful workflows  
\- Redesign weak workflows  
\- Retire workflows that fail to demonstrate value

There is no penalty for retiring a workflow early.

\---

\#\# Practitioner Responsibilities

Every IA practitioner is responsible for:  
\- Upholding the workflow definition standard  
\- Enforcing economic measurement  
\- Preventing local optimization  
\- Making system effects explicit  
\- Escalating tradeoffs when needed

\---

\#\# Guiding Principle

\> Our credibility is earned by the workflows we put into production and the economic impact they deliver across the entire organization.
