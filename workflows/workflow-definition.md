\# Workflow Definition & Economic Impact Standard

\#\# Purpose

This document defines what Intelligent Agency means by a \*workflow\* and establishes the definitive standard for how workflows are identified, designed, implemented, and measured.

This standard is used across Intelligent Agency for:  
\- Product development  
\- Client engagements  
\- Roadmap prioritization  
\- Economic impact reporting  
\- Intelligent OS maturity assessment

If something does not meet this definition, it is not treated as a workflow within Intelligent OS.

\---

\#\# What Is a Workflow?

At Intelligent Agency, a workflow is:

\> \*\*A repeatable, end-to-end business process that converts inputs into outcomes through a defined sequence of decisions and actions, and whose economic impact can be measured.\*\*

A workflow is \*\*not\*\*:  
\- A feature  
\- A tool  
\- A task list  
\- A one-off automation  
\- A slide-level use case

A workflow exists only when it can be:  
\- Executed repeatedly  
\- Owned by the business  
\- Measured economically  
\- Operated with or without AI assistance

\---

\#\# Required Characteristics of a Workflow

Every workflow must meet \*\*all\*\* of the following criteria.

\#\#\# 1\. Clear Trigger  
A defined event or condition that initiates the workflow.

Examples:  
\- A customer request is submitted  
\- A forecast variance exceeds tolerance  
\- A contract reaches renewal window

\---

\#\#\# 2\. Defined Inputs  
The data, context, or signals required to execute the workflow.  
Inputs may be structured or unstructured, human- or system-generated.

\---

\#\#\# 3\. Decision Logic  
The rules, judgments, or reasoning applied during execution.  
This may include:  
\- Human decisions  
\- AI-assisted decisions  
\- Fully automated decisions

\---

\#\#\# 4\. Actions & Outputs  
Concrete actions taken and outputs produced, such as:  
\- Reports  
\- Recommendations  
\- Transactions  
\- Approvals  
\- Customer communications

\---

\#\#\# 5\. Business Owner  
A named role accountable for workflow performance and outcomes.  
Ownership cannot be delegated to “the system.”

\---

\#\#\# 6\. Repeatability  
The workflow must be executed across time and cases, and ideally across teams or clients.

\---

\#\#\# 7\. Economic Impact  
The workflow must produce one or more of the following:  
\- Time savings  
\- Cost reduction  
\- Revenue increase  
\- Risk reduction (with quantified proxy)

If economic impact cannot be defined, the workflow does not qualify.

\---

\#\# Workflow System Fit

In addition to delivering local economic impact, every workflow must be assessed for how it integrates with and improves the broader organization.

\*\*Workflow System Fit\*\* evaluates how a workflow:  
\- Interacts with other workflows  
\- Affects upstream and downstream processes  
\- Contributes to enterprise-wide objectives  
\- Improves the organization’s overall ability to execute strategy

A workflow that produces local gains but degrades system performance does not meet Intelligent Agency’s standard.

\---

\#\#\# Required System Fit Criteria

Every workflow definition must explicitly document:

1\. \*\*Upstream Dependencies\*\*  
   \- Which workflows, teams, or systems provide inputs  
   \- Sensitivity to upstream variability or delays

2\. \*\*Downstream Effects\*\*  
   \- Which workflows or teams consume outputs  
   \- Changes to timing, quality, or volume of downstream work

3\. \*\*Cross-Functional Impact\*\*  
   \- Functions affected (e.g., Product, Sales, Finance, Operations)  
   \- Whether handoffs are reduced, unchanged, or increased

4\. \*\*Decision & Incentive Alignment\*\*  
   \- Whether the workflow reinforces shared goals and KPIs  
   \- Whether it introduces conflicting incentives or measurements

5\. \*\*Enterprise Goal Contribution\*\*  
   \- Which enterprise-level objectives the workflow supports  
   \- How it strengthens the organization’s operating capability

\---

\#\#\# System Fit Requirement

A workflow may only advance beyond POV if:  
\- Its system interactions are understood  
\- Its net effect on the organization is positive or neutral  
\- Any tradeoffs are explicit and accepted

\---

\#\# Workflow Phases

Workflows progress through four phases:

\- \*\*POV\*\* — Defined and prioritized  
\- \*\*POC\*\* — Prototyped and validated  
\- \*\*Pilot\*\* — Operating in production with real users  
\- \*\*Program\*\* — Scaled, governed, and sustained

Progression requires evidence, not intent.

\---

\#\# Relationship to Intelligent OS

Every workflow activates one or more Intelligent OS layers:  
\- Workflow Layer  
\- Agent Layer  
\- Orchestration Layer  
\- Intelligence Layer  
\- CEO Synthesis Layer

Workflows are the mechanism through which Intelligent OS delivers value.

\---

\#\# Relationship to the North Star

All workflows roll up to IA’s North Star:

\> \*\*Production workflows with verified dollars saved or earned\*\*

This ensures alignment across Product, Delivery, Sales, and Leadership.

\---

\#\# Governing Principle

\> If a workflow cannot be clearly defined, owned, measured economically, and shown to improve the broader system, it does not belong in Intelligent OS.
