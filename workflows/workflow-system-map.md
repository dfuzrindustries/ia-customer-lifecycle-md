# Workflow System Map Template

## Purpose

The Workflow System Map documents how a workflow integrates with the broader organization and how it contributes to overall system performance.

This template is required for all workflows advancing beyond POV and is used to:
- Prevent local optimization
- Reveal upstream and downstream dependencies
- Surface cross-functional impacts
- Ensure workflows contribute to enterprise goals
- Support governance and graduation decisions

A workflow that cannot be mapped at the system level does not meet Intelligent Agency’s standard.

## 1. Workflow Overview

Workflow Name:  
Business Owner:  
Primary Function:  
Current Phase (POV / POC / Pilot / Program):  
Date:  
Prepared By:  

---

## 2. Workflow Role in the System

Indicate the primary role(s) this workflow plays. Select all that apply.

- [ ] Source Workflow — generates data, demand, or signals used elsewhere  
- [ ] Transformation Workflow — analyzes, evaluates, or optimizes information  
- [ ] Execution Workflow — acts on decisions or delivers outcomes  
- [ ] Governance Workflow — reviews, approves, escalates, or enforces controls

## 3. Upstream Workflow Integration (Inputs)

| Upstream Workflow | Function | Input Provided | Frequency | Known Issues / Variability |
|------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|----------------------------|
|                  |          |                |           |                            |
|                  |          |                |           |                            |

---

## 4. Downstream Workflow Integration (Outputs)

| Downstream Workflow | Function | Output Consumed | Dependency Criticality |
|--------------------|----------|------------------|------------------------|
|                    |          |                  | Low / Medium / High |
|                    |          |                  | Low / Medium / High |

- [ ] Product
- [ ] Sales
- [ ] Marketing
- [ ] Finance
- [ ] Operations
- [ ] Customer Success
- [ ] IT / Data
- [ ] Legal / Compliance
- [ ] Other:

Describe the impact on each affected function:

---

## 6. Shared Resources & Constraints

Shared resources impacted:

- [ ] People capacity
- [ ] Data pipelines
- [ ] Systems / tools
- [ ] Governance forums
- [ ] Budget / capital

Constraints, contention, or dependencies:

---

## 7. System-Level Effects (Before vs After)

| Dimension | Before | After | Net Effect |
|---------|--------|-------|------------|
| Coordination effort | | | Positive / Neutral / Negative |
| Decision quality | | | Positive / Neutral / Negative |
| Cycle time | | | Positive / Neutral / Negative |
| Bottlenecks shifted | | | Positive / Neutral / Negative |

---

## 8. Incentives & KPI Alignment

| KPI | Function | Effect |
|----|----------|--------|
|    |          | + / 0 / - |
|    |          | + / 0 / - |

Assessment of incentive alignment:

---

## 9. Enterprise Goal Contribution

Enterprise objectives supported:

- [ ] Revenue growth
- [ ] Margin expansion
- [ ] Customer retention
- [ ] Risk reduction
- [ ] Speed to market
- [ ] Operating efficiency
- [ ] Innovation capacity

Describe contribution to enterprise goals:

---

## 10. System Fit Summary

System Fit Rating:

- [ ] Positive — improves performance across multiple workflows or functions
- [ ] Neutral — local improvement with minimal system effect
- [ ] Negative — creates friction or degradation elsewhere

Rationale:

Required actions (if Neutral or Negative):

---

## 11. Review & Decision

Reviewed By:  
Role:  
Date:  

Decision:
- [ ] Advance
- [ ] Redesign
- [ ] Hold
- [ ] Retire

Notes:

---

## Governing Principle

A workflow is only successful if it improves the performance of the system it operates within.
