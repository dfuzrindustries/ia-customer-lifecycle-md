# Workflows & Operations Standards

**Defining, measuring, and optimizing workflows across the customer lifecycle**

---

## Overview

These documents establish Intelligent Agency's standards for workflow identification, design, implementation, and measurement across all client engagements.

Every workflow at IA must meet defined criteria, demonstrate economic impact, and improve the broader organizational system—not just deliver local optimization.

---

## Core Documents

### [Workflow Definition](workflow-definition.md)
**What qualifies as a workflow and required characteristics**

Defines the definitive standard for what constitutes a workflow at Intelligent Agency. Establishes the seven required characteristics and system fit criteria that every workflow must meet.

**Use this when:**
- Identifying opportunities in Day 1 workshops
- Qualifying POC candidates
- Prioritizing roadmap items
- Reporting economic impact

---

### [Workflow Playbook](workflow-playbook.md)
**Step-by-step guide for workflow implementation**

Practical guidance for IA practitioners on how to identify, design, validate, and scale workflows through POV, POC, Pilot, and Program phases.

**Use this when:**
- Executing Day 1 workshops
- Planning POC scope and success criteria
- Designing Pilot deployment strategies
- Measuring and reporting Program impact

---

### [Workflow System Map Template](workflow-system-map.md)
**Template for mapping workflow integration and system-level effects**

Required template for documenting how workflows integrate with the broader organization, including upstream/downstream dependencies, cross-functional impacts, and enterprise goal contribution.

**Use this when:**
- Advancing workflows from POV to POC
- Assessing Pilot readiness
- Reporting Program results
- Making graduation decisions

---

### [Service Blueprint](service-blueprint.md)
**Complete customer lifecycle workflows, touchpoints, and handoffs**

Comprehensive blueprint mapping the entire IA customer journey from M1 through Partnership, showing customer actions, frontstage/backstage activities, support processes, and critical handoff points.

**Use this when:**
- Onboarding new team members
- Planning phase transitions
- Identifying handoff failure modes
- Optimizing internal operations

---

## When to Use These Documents

### Sales & Qualification (M1-M3)
- Reference **Workflow Definition** when discussing scope and impact with prospects
- Use **Service Blueprint** to explain IA's delivery methodology
- Understand handoffs between Sales and Delivery

### Day 1 Workshop
- Apply **Workflow Definition** to identify and validate opportunities
- Use **Workflow Playbook** Steps 1-4 to assess workflows
- Begin **System Map** for top 1-3 opportunities

### POC (Proof of Concept)
- Follow **Workflow Playbook** Steps 5-7 for design and validation
- Complete **System Map** for workflows advancing to Pilot
- Measure against baseline (Playbook Step 3)

### Pilot (Production Deployment)
- Use **Workflow Playbook** Steps 7-8 to verify economic impact
- Reference **Service Blueprint** for Pilot → Program handoff
- Ensure system fit rating is Positive or Neutral

### Program (Transformation)
- Scale workflows using **Workflow Playbook** Step 9 (graduate or retire)
- Update **System Maps** to reflect enterprise-wide deployment
- Report verified economic impact to North Star

### Partnership (Ongoing Innovation)
- Apply standards to co-created innovations
- Measure system-level impact across joint workflows
- Maintain economic impact reporting discipline

## Key Principles

### 1. Economic Impact is Non-Negotiable
Every workflow must demonstrate dollars saved or earned. If economic impact cannot be measured, it does not qualify as a workflow.

### 2. System Fit Matters
Local optimization that degrades overall system performance does not meet IA's standard. Workflows must improve the broader organization.

### 3. Evidence Over Intent
Workflows progress through phases (POV → POC → Pilot → Program) based on demonstrated results, not aspirations.

### 4. Business Ownership Required
Workflows must have named business owners accountable for outcomes. Ownership cannot be delegated to "the system."

### 5. Repeatability is Essential
One-off automations, features, or tools are not workflows. Workflows must be repeatable across time, teams, and clients.

## Relationship to North Star

All workflows roll up to IA's North Star:

> **Production workflows with verified dollars saved or earned**

These standards ensure alignment across Product, Delivery, Sales, and Leadership on what counts as a workflow and how impact is measured.

---

## Practitioner Responsibilities

Every IA team member is responsible for:

✓ Upholding the workflow definition standard  
✓ Enforcing economic measurement  
✓ Preventing local optimization  
✓ Making system effects explicit  
✓ Escalating tradeoffs when needed  

---

## Governing Principle

> If a workflow cannot be clearly defined, owned, measured economically, and shown to improve the broader system, it does not belong in Intelligent OS.
