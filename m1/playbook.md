## Play 1 — Pre-M1 Prep Call | 15 minutes

#### Objectives

- Confirm meeting objective and desired outcome
- Understand basic context and pain points
- Set expectations for M1 format
- Confirm attendees from both sides

#### Activities

1. **Schedule prep call:** Coordinate with primary contact 2-3 days before M1
2. **Prep call agenda:**
   - "What's prompting this conversation?" (their trigger)
   - "What are you hoping to get out of our M1 meeting?" (their goal)
   - "Who else should be in the room?" (identify stakeholders)
   - "What format works best for you?" (set expectations)
3. **Share M1 agenda:** Send preliminary agenda after prep call
4. **Confirm logistics:** Meeting time, attendees, any materials to review

#### RACI Matrix

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Schedule Prep Call | A/R | I | I | - |

## Play 2 — M1 Meeting Execution | 60 minutes

### Part 1: Credentialize (0-15 min)

Build trust and establish expertise before asking questions.

#### Objectives

- Establish Intelligent Agency's credibility
- Share relevant POV and expertise
- Manage expectations for the sales process
- Make them want to ask YOU questions

#### Activities & Scripts

**1. Opening (2 min)**

Script:
> "Thanks for making time today. Before we dive in, I want to set expectations for our conversation. This isn't a pitch—we're here to understand if there's genuine fit between what you need and what we do. Sound good?"

**2. Who We Are (5 min)**

Cover:
- IA overview (outcome-obsessed AI transformation)
- Our POV on [their relevant challenge area]
- How we're different (partnership, not vendor)

Key Point: Keep this concise. Less is more.

**3. Process Expectations (3 min)**

Script:
> "Our process has three meetings. Today—M1—is about qualification and fit. If there's a match, we'll meet again for M2 where we'll collaborate on solution possibilities. Then M3 is where we review a formal proposal together. We only move forward if there's genuine fit. Fair?"

**4. Relevant Success Stories (5 min)**

Share 1-2 case studies:
- Same vertical OR same problem
- Focus on OUTCOMES, not features
- Keep it brief (2-3 minutes each max)

#### Critical Success Indicator

**Are they asking YOU questions?**

If yes → You've credentialized well, proceed to qualify
If no → They're not engaged; pause and ask: "Is this relevant to what you're trying to achieve?"

#### RACI Matrix

| Activity | Business Lead | SME | EM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Opening & Framing | A/R | - | - |
| IA Overview | A/R | C | - |
| Success Stories | R | R | I |

---

### Part 2: Qualify with BANT (15-45 min)

Understand their world using the BANT framework.

#### Objectives

- Complete Budget qualification
- Identify Authority and decision process
- Understand Need and urgency
- Confirm Timeline and drivers

#### BANT Discovery Scripts

**BUDGET Questions:**

- "What budget range have you allocated for this initiative?"
  - *Follow-up if vague:* "To help me frame solution possibilities, are we talking $50K, $500K, or $5M?"
- "How does this fit into your fiscal planning?"
- "What's driving the timing of this investment?"

**Note:** Most clients won't give exact numbers immediately. Listen for ranges, triggers, or budget approval status.

**AUTHORITY Questions:**

- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
  - *Listen for buying committee members*
- "Walk me through your approval process"
  - *Map the decision chain*
- "Who will own the success of this initiative internally?"
  - *Identify champion vs. decision maker*

**Red Flag:** If they can't articulate the decision process, this may not be a real opportunity.

**NEED Questions:**

- "What's driving this need now?" (Why now?)
- "What happens if you don't solve this?" (Cost of inaction)
- "What have you tried before?" (Previous attempts)
  - *Follow-up:* "What worked? What didn't?"
- "What does success look like?" (Measurable outcomes)
  - *Get specific numbers:* "How would you measure that?"

**TIMELINE Questions:**

- "When do you need to have this solved by?"
- "What's driving that timeline?" (External constraint or internal goal?)
- "Are there any events or deadlines we should know about?"

#### Additional Discovery Questions

**Prioritization:**
- "Of everything we've discussed, what are the top 3 things that matter MOST?"
  - *Rank them 1-2-3*

**Non-Negotiables:**
- "What are your absolute must-haves?" (Hard requirements)
- "Where do you have flexibility?"

**Past Experience:**
- "You mentioned you've worked with [vendor]..."
  - "What did you like about how they worked?"
  - "What would you want us to do differently?"

#### Talk/Listen Ratio

**Target: 40/60 rule** — You talk 40%, they talk 60%

If you're talking more than them, you're pitching, not qualifying.

#### RACI Matrix

| Activity | Business Lead | SME | EM |
|---|---|---|---|
| BANT Discovery | A/R | C | I |
| Need Assessment | R | R | I |
| Technical Feasibility | C | R | I |

#### ✓ BANT Completion Checklist

- [ ] Budget range understood (or constraints identified)
- [ ] Decision makers identified
- [ ] Approval process mapped
- [ ] Need clearly articulated
- [ ] Cost of inaction understood
- [ ] Success criteria defined (measurable)
- [ ] Timeline confirmed with drivers
- [ ] Top 3 priorities ranked

---

### Part 3: Get Permission for M2 (45-60 min)

Soft close: Earn permission to come back with solution possibilities.

#### Objectives

- Confirm there's fit worth exploring
- Get permission to "think on their behalf"
- Schedule M2 with right attendees
- Set expectations for M2 format

#### The Ask — Soft Close Script

> "This has been really helpful. Based on what you've shared—[recap their top priorities]—I think there's real potential for us to help. Would it be okay if I met with my team, did some thinking on your behalf, and came back with some solution possibilities we could shape together? Does [specific date/time] work for M2?"

**Why This Works:**
- Permission-based (not assumptive)
- Collaborative framing ("shape together")
- Specific ask (date/time for M2)

#### Confirm Before Leaving

**Critical Items:**
1. M2 date/time locked
2. Who will attend from their side (buying committee?)
3. Who we should bring (EM, SME?)
4. Any materials they can share before M2
5. Next communication touchpoint

#### If They Hesitate

**Option A: "Let me think about it"**

Response:
> "Of course. What additional information would help you decide if this is worth exploring further?"

*Then provide that information and reschedule the ask.*

**Option B: "I'm not sure this is a fit"**

Response:
> "I appreciate your honesty. Can I ask what's giving you pause?"

*Listen, address concerns, or gracefully close if not a fit.*

**Option C: "I need to talk to [other person] first"**

Response:
> "Makes sense. Should we include [other person] in M2 so we're all on the same page?"

#### RACI Matrix

| Activity | Business Lead | SME | EM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Soft Close | A/R | C | I |
| M2 Scheduling | A/R | I | C |
| Follow-up Planning | A/R | - | C |

#### ✓ Completion Checklist

- [ ] M2 scheduled (date/time confirmed)
- [ ] M2 attendees identified (client side)
- [ ] M2 attendees identified (IA side)
- [ ] Permission granted to "think on their behalf"
- [ ] Next communication point set

## Common M1 Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake #1: Going in Blind

**Problem:** No prep call, no context, winging it

**Fix:** Always do 15-min prep call. Non-negotiable.

---

### Mistake #2: Pitching Too Early

**Problem:** Leading with "let me tell you about our platform..."

**Fix:** Credentialize first, THEN qualify. Earn the right to pitch in M2.

---

### Mistake #3: Talking Too Much

**Problem:** You talk 70%, they talk 30%

**Fix:** Force yourself to ask questions and LISTEN. Aim for 40/60.

---

### Mistake #4: Not Asking About Budget

**Problem:** Avoiding the money conversation

**Fix:** Ask about budget early and directly. It's respectful and qualifying.

---

### Mistake #5: Skipping Authority Questions

**Problem:** Assuming the person in the room is the decision maker

**Fix:** Always ask "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"

---

### Mistake #6: Forgetting to Get M2

**Problem:** Good conversation, but no next steps

**Fix:** ALWAYS secure M2 before leaving. It's the goal of M1.

---

### Mistake #7: No Follow-Up

**Problem:** Meeting ends, nothing sent, momentum dies

**Fix:** Follow-up email within 2 hours. CRM update within 24 hours.

---

### Mistake #8: Weak Opportunity Brief

**Problem:** Vague notes, missing BANT, can't prep for M2

**Fix:** Detailed brief required. If you can't fill it out, you didn't qualify.

---

## M1 Success Metrics

### You've had a successful M1 if:

✅ **They're asking YOU questions** (credentialization worked)  
✅ **You have clear BANT information** (complete qualification)  
✅ **M2 is scheduled** with key decision makers  
✅ **You understand their top 3 priorities** (not just generic goals)  
✅ **You know what success looks like** (measurable, specific)  
✅ **You have permission to "think on their behalf"**  
✅ **Internal team agrees this is a good opportunity** (go/no-go)  
✅ **Opportunity brief is complete and detailed**  

### Red Flags (Consider No-Go)

❌ Unclear budget or "no budget allocated"  
❌ Can't identify decision maker  
❌ No urgency or timeline  
❌ Vague need ("we're just exploring")  
❌ They want a pitch, not a partnership  
❌ Poor strategic fit with IA capabilities  
❌ Champion has no authority or influence
