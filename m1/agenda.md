You'll build trust by demonstrating expertise, qualify the opportunity using BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline), and earn permission to shape a solution together in M2.

## Meeting Flow

### Part 1: CREDENTIALIZE (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Build trust, establish expertise, manage expectations

**What We Share:**

1. **Who We Are**
   - Intelligent Agency overview
   - Our point of view on [their relevant challenge]
   - Why we're different (collaborative, not transactional)

2. **Process Expectations**
   - "We believe in no blind dates—that's why we had our prep call"
   - "Our process has 3 meetings: M1 (qualify), M2 (shape), M3 (propose)"
   - "We only move forward if there's genuine fit"

3. **Relevant Success Stories**
   - 1-2 case studies (same vertical or similar problem)
   - Concrete outcomes, not just activities

**Critical Success Factor:** *Make them ask YOU questions.* If you've credentialized well, they'll want to know more.

**Key Mindset:** *Love us, believe us, trust us.*

#### Discovery Framework (BANT)

**BUDGET**

- "What's driving the timing of this investment?"

**AUTHORITY**
- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- "Walk me through your approval process"
- "Who will own the success of this initiative internally?"

**NEED**
- "What's driving this need now?" (Why now?)
- "What happens if you don't solve this?"

- "What does success look like?" (concrete, measurable)

**TIMELINE**
- "When do you need to have this solved by?"
- "What's driving that timeline?"
- "Are there any external deadlines or events?"

#### Additional Discovery Questions

- "What are your non-negotiables?" (must-haves)
- "What's the cost of inaction?"
- "Previous vendors: What did you like? Not like?"

**Critical Mindset:** *Get permission to act on their behalf. We're solving THEIR problem.*

### Part 3: GET PERMISSION FOR M2 (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Soft close, confirm next steps

**The Ask:**

> "Would it be okay if we met again after I've talked with my team? I'd like to bring back some solution possibilities that we can shape together. Does [date/time] work for M2?"

**What This Does:**
- Gets permission to think on their behalf
- Signals we're invested
- Sets up collaborative (not pitch) approach

**Confirm Before Leaving:**

## M1 Success Mantras

> "We're not here to pitch. We're here to understand if we can genuinely help. If there's a fit, we'll shape a solution together in M2. If there's not a fit, that's okay too—we'd rather know now."

**End Goal:** Walk out with a complete understanding of their challenge and an M2 on the calendar.

**We Don't Say:**
- "Let me tell you about our platform..."
