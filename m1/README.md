## Purpose

The M1 Initial Sales Meeting transforms a lead into a qualified opportunity. This is not a pitch—it's a collaborative discovery session designed to answer the critical question: **Is there genuine fit between what they need and what we do?**

By the end of 60 minutes, you will have complete BANT qualification (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline), clear understanding of their top 3 priorities, and an M2 meeting scheduled to shape the solution together.
