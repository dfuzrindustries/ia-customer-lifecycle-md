## M3 Purpose

The M3 Proposal Review Meeting is where we review the formal proposal together. This is not a "take it or leave it" presentation—it's a collaborative session where we make sure we've got everything exactly right.

You've already received and reviewed the proposal (sent 24-48 hours before this meeting). Today, we'll walk through it together, address your questions, make any necessary adjustments, and if it feels right, agree on next steps to move forward.

## ✓ Success Criteria

- **Proposal reviewed** — You've read it before the meeting

- **Adjustments agreed upon** — Any needed refinements documented

- **Next steps defined** — Internal approval process and timeline clear
- **Contracting path established** — Who signs, when, what's needed
- **Kickoff date tentatively set** — Target start date agreed

## Meeting Flow

### Part 1: FRAME THE MEETING (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Set collaborative tone, confirm they've reviewed

**Our Opening:**

> "Thanks for taking the time to review the proposal. Before we dive in, I want to frame today's conversation. This isn't a 'take it or leave it' meeting—we want to make sure we've got this exactly right.
>
> Our goal is to address your questions, make any necessary adjustments, and if it feels right, agree on next steps to move forward together."

**We'll Confirm:**
- "Have you had a chance to review the proposal?"
- "What questions came up as you read it?"
- "Before we go through it section by section, are there any big-picture reactions?"

**Key Mindset:** *This is still collaborative. We're refining together, not defending.*

## M3 Success Mantras

> "We've shaped this solution together. This proposal reflects your priorities and our expertise. If it's right, let's move forward. If it needs adjustment, let's refine it. Either way, we're committed to getting this exactly right."

**End Goal:** Verbal commitment → Signed contract → Project kickoff.

## Communication Framework

**Voice:** Collaborative, solution-oriented, responsive  
**NOT:** Defensive, rigid, pressuring  

**We Say:**
- "What questions do you have about..."
- "Let's address that—here's what we're thinking..."
- "That's a great point—how would you want to adjust..."
- "We can definitely make that work..."

**We Don't Say:**
- "We already explained that in the proposal..."
- "That's not negotiable..."
- "Take it or leave it..."
- "We don't typically do that..."
