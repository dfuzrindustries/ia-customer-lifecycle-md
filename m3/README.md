## Purpose

The M3 Proposal Review Meeting transforms a shaped solution into a closed deal. This is not a "take it or leave it" meeting—it's a collaborative refinement session where you review the proposal together, address questions, and agree on next steps.

By the end of 60 minutes, you will have addressed all concerns, refined any needed elements, secured verbal commitment, and established a clear path to signed contract and project kickoff.
