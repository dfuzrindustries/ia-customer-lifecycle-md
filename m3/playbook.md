#### Opening Script

> "Thanks for taking the time to review the proposal. Before we dive in, I want to frame today's conversation. This isn't a 'take it or leave it' meeting—we want to make sure we've got this exactly right.
>
> Our goal is to address your questions, make any necessary adjustments, and if it feels right, agree on next steps to move forward together."

#### Confirm They've Reviewed

Ask:
- "Have you had a chance to review the proposal?"
- "What questions came up as you read it?"
- "Before we go through it section by section, are there any big-picture reactions?"

**If they HAVEN'T reviewed it:**

Response:
> "No problem. Would it make more sense to reschedule so you have time to review? Or would you like us to walk through it now and we can follow up with questions afterward?"

*Rescheduling is often better—hard to close if they haven't read it.*

**Response Framework:**
1. Acknowledge: "I hear you. Let's look at how we could phase this."
2. Explain rationale: "We structured it this way because [dependencies/value]."
3. Explore alternatives: "We could start with Phase 1 [describe], prove value, then expand."
4. Confirm impact: "That would change timeline to [X] and price to [Y]. Does that work better?"

**Question:** "What if we remove [X]?"

**Response Framework:**
1. Understand: "Help me understand—what's driving that?"
2. Explain impact: "Removing [X] would affect [outcome/timeline/other deliverables]."
3. Offer alternatives: "Could we instead [simplify/defer/replace]?"
4. Document: "Let me capture this adjustment and we'll update the SOW."

**ON PRICING**

**Question:** "This is more than we budgeted."

**Response Framework:**
1. Empathize: "I appreciate your candor. Let's work through this."
2. Reframe value: "When we look at the ROI—[specific outcomes and value]—the payback period is [X months]."
3. Explore options:
   - "Could we phase it to spread the investment?"
   - "What if we structured it as outcome-based pricing?" (ECIF model)
   - "We could start with a smaller scope to prove value first."
4. Know your floor: "Let me check with my team on what's possible within your budget."

**Question:** "Can you discount?"

**Response Framework:**
1. Don't cave immediately: "Help me understand what would make this work for you."
2. Get something in return: "If we adjusted the price, could we [get referral/case study/longer term/etc.]?"
3. Offer alternatives:
   - Value-adds instead of discount (training, ongoing support)
   - Payment terms flexibility

4. Escalate if needed: "Let me discuss with my GM and get back to you by EOD."

**Discount Authority:**

2. Explain constraints: "The current timeline accounts for [dependencies/testing/etc.]."
3. Explore options: "We could add resources to compress by [X weeks], but that increases cost by [Y]."

**Question:** "Can we start later?"

**Response Framework:**
1. Understand: "What's changing on your end?"
2. Check resource impact: "Let me confirm our team availability if we push to [new date]."
3. Adjust timeline: "We can adjust. New timeline would be [start date] to [end date]."

2. Share qualifications: "[Name] has [X years] experience in [relevant domain]."
3. Offer introduction: "Would you like to meet them before we start?"

**Question:** "Can we have [specific person]?"

**Response Framework:**
1. If yes: "Yes, [name] is allocated to this project."
2. If no: "Let me check [name]'s availability and get back to you by [date]."
3. If unavailable: "[Name] isn't available, but [alternative] has similar experience in [domain]. Would you like to meet them?"

#### Sales Training: Tactics to Get to YES

Remember: "What do we need to get them to say YES?"

**Option 1: Outcome-Based Pricing**
- "What if you only pay for results, not just effort?"
- Align incentives with their success

**Option 2: Phased Approach**
- "Let's start with Phase 1, prove value, then continue"
- Reduces initial commitment and risk

**Option 3: ECIF (Earn Client's Investment First)**
- "We'll deliver value before you pay full price"
- Risk reversal—we take on the risk

**Option 4: Value-Adds**
- Include extras that cost us little but add value to them
- Training, documentation, ongoing support, tool licenses

**Option 5: Payment Terms Flexibility**
- Spread payments over time
- Align with their fiscal calendar
- Net 45 or Net 60 instead of Net 30

**Option 6: Start Now, PO Later**
- "We can begin with verbal commitment while your PO processes"
- Shows confidence and urgency

**Option 7: Investment in Relationship**
- Travel to their office for kickoff
- Bring executives to demonstrate commitment
- Provide reference calls with similar clients

**Give to Get Philosophy:**
- If you give discount, get case study or referral
- If you add scope, get faster payment or longer engagement
- Always trade, never just give away value

#### Activities

**1. Stay Engaged (Without Being Annoying)**

- Check in every 2-3 days

- Offer executive summary
- Provide talking points
- Share ROI model
- Make yourself available for questions

**How to Unstick:**
- Escalate to decision maker
- Offer executive-to-executive call
- Provide deadline with reasoning (e.g., resource availability)
- Consider walking away if no progress

**4. Sales Training Tactic: "Start Work with Verbal"**

If appropriate:
> "While your PO is processing, we could begin planning and kickoff prep under our verbal agreement. Would that be helpful?"

Shows confidence and urgency, gets work started.

## Common M3 Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Mistake #1: Sending Proposal Day of M3

**Problem:** No time for client to review

**Fix:** ALWAYS send 24-48 hours before M3. Non-negotiable.

---

### Mistake #2: Being Defensive

**Problem:** Treating questions as attacks

**Fix:** Stay collaborative. Questions = engagement. Welcome them.

---

### Mistake #3: Not Addressing Price Concerns

**Problem:** Avoiding the money conversation

**Fix:** Talk about value and outcomes. Offer options. Be creative.

---

### Mistake #4: Winging It

**Problem:** No prep for questions and objections

**Fix:** Internal M3 prep meeting is mandatory. Anticipate and prepare.

---

### Mistake #5: Not Getting Verbal Commitment

**Problem:** Good meeting, but no decision

**Fix:** ALWAYS deliver the soft close. Ask for the decision.

---

### Mistake #6: Poor Follow-Up

**Problem:** Meeting ends, no email, momentum dies

**Fix:** Follow-up email within 2 hours. Every time.

---

### Mistake #7: Not Involving Legal Early

**Problem:** Legal review delays contract by weeks

**Fix:** Get IA legal involved early if custom MSA or complex terms.

---

### Mistake #8: Celebrating Too Early

**Problem:** Verbal ≠ Signed. Deals fall apart.

**Fix:** Stay engaged through contracting. Don't assume it's done.

### Mistake #9: Poor Sales-to-Delivery Handoff

**Problem:** EM not prepped, client expectations misaligned

**Fix:** Formal handoff meeting. EM fully briefed before kickoff.

## M3 Success Metrics

### You've had a successful M3 if:

✅ **Proposal reviewed** before meeting  
✅ **All questions addressed** thoroughly  
✅ **Adjustments agreed upon** and documented  
✅ **Verbal commitment secured** ("yes, let's move forward")  
✅ **Next steps defined** (approval process, timeline)  
✅ **Internal approval timeline** understood  
✅ **Contracting process** mapped out  
✅ **Kickoff date** tentatively set  
✅ **Champion actively advocating** internally  

### Red Flags (Deal at Risk)

❌ They didn't read the proposal  
❌ New concerns not surfaced in M1/M2  
❌ Can't identify who signs the contract  
❌ No timeline for decision  
❌ "We need to think about it" with no specifics  
❌ Budget concerns that weren't in M1  
❌ Key decision maker not in M3

## The M3 Mantra

> "We've shaped this solution together. This proposal reflects your priorities and our expertise. If it's right, let's move forward. If it needs adjustment, let's refine it. Either way, we're committed to getting this exactly right."

**The Goal:** Verbal commitment → Signed contract → Project kickoff.

**The Mindset:** Collaborative refinement, not hard-selling.

**The Outcome:** A closed deal with a client who's excited to begin.
