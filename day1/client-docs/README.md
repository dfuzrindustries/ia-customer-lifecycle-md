# Day 1 Executive Overview

## Overview

Day 1 is an executive working session designed to accelerate AI transformation by enabling clear, defensible decisions about where to invest next.

Rather than starting with tools or experimentation, Day 1 focuses leadership on the workflows and foundations that materially affect business performance, and determines the fastest path to measurable economic impact.

---

## What Day 1 Does

Day 1 is designed to:

- Surface the highest-value opportunities for AI-enabled workflows  
- Assess organizational readiness to execute  
- Align leaders on priorities, tradeoffs, and next steps  
- Establish a clear transition into execution  

---

## Two Entry Paths (Chosen Based on Context)

### Automated Workflows

This entry path is used when sources of value are visible and well understood.

**Focus:**
- Identifying and prioritizing specific workflows  
- Evaluating feasibility and impact  
- Producing a short list of execution-ready workflow candidates

**Client Documents:**
- **[Client Guide: Automated Workflows](guide-workflows.md)** — Comprehensive preparation guide
- **[Quick Reference: Automated Workflows](quick-workflows.md)** — One-page overview

---

### Data & AI Foundation

This entry path is used when value is constrained by foundational readiness gaps.

**Focus:**
- Data, decision, and operating foundations  
- Identifying constraints that limit automation  
- Producing a sequenced roadmap to unlock automation and AI adoption

**Client Documents:**
- **[Client Guide: Data & AI Foundation](guide-foundation.md)** — Comprehensive preparation guide
- **[Quick Reference: Data & AI Foundation](quick-foundation.md)** — One-page overview

---

## What Leaders Leave With

At the conclusion of Day 1, leaders will have:

- 1-3 clearly prioritized opportunities  
- Defined economic impact hypotheses  
- A clear understanding of constraints and risks  
- A recommended next phase: **POC**, **Pilot**, or **Program**
