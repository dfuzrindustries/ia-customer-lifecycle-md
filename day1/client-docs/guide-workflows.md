# Day 1 Workshop — Client Guide  
## Automated Workflows

## Executive Summary

The Day 1 Workshop is an executive working session focused on identifying and prioritizing high-value workflows for automation. The objective is to surface a small number of concrete opportunities that can deliver measurable economic impact, not to generate ideas or explore technology in the abstract.

This session is designed for senior leaders responsible for performance, resource allocation, and execution.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the Day 1 Workshop is to:
- Identify 1-3 workflows with clear potential to reduce cost or increase revenue
- Establish a shared, fact-based understanding of current-state constraints
- Define a pragmatic path from opportunity to execution, including clear next steps

---

## What This Session Is — and Is Not

### This session is:
- A structured diagnostic and prioritization exercise
- Grounded in real workflows, operating data, and decision contexts
- Focused on feasibility, impact, and execution readiness

### This session is not:
- A generic discovery workshop
- A technology demonstration
- A strategy offsite or visioning exercise

---

## What We Will Do

During the session, we will:
- Examine critical workflows across the business
- Identify sources of friction, delay, and manual effort
- Quantify cost, time, and performance implications
- Assess readiness for automation and AI enablement
- Prioritize workflows based on economic impact and feasibility

The emphasis is on decisions and tradeoffs, not exhaustive analysis.

---

## What You Will Leave With

At the conclusion of the session, participants will have:
- A prioritized list of 1-3 workflows to pursue
- A clear articulation of expected economic impact
- An understanding of key risks and dependencies
- A recommended next step (POC, Pilot, or readiness work)

---

## How to Prepare

Participants should be prepared to discuss:
- Persistent operational bottlenecks
- Areas of recurring manual effort or coordination cost
- Decisions that materially affect performance or outcomes

The effectiveness of the session depends on candid discussion and concrete examples.
