# Day 1 Workshop — Client Guide  
## Data & AI Foundation

## Executive Summary

Sustainable automation and AI adoption depend on a reliable data and operating foundation. This Day 1 Workshop focuses on assessing the maturity of the data, decision, and operating environment to determine where targeted investment will unlock the greatest downstream value.

This session is designed for leaders who recognize that automation is an organizational capability, not a point solution.
