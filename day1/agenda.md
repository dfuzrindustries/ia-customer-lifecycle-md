**Duration:** 6 hours  
**Investment:** $25,000  
**Location:** Client site or virtual

## Workshop Purpose

The Day 1 Workshop is a structured, facilitated session designed to identify 1 to 3 high-value workflow redesign opportunities that will either save you money or make you money. We will assess your organization's readiness to execute these opportunities and provide a clear view of your current state alongside our recommended path to measurable business impact.

This is not a discovery session. This is a diagnostic and prioritization workshop that produces immediate, actionable intelligence and a concrete roadmap for implementation.
