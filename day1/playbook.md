   - "What are your current OKRs or quarterly goals?"
   - "Where are you ahead/behind on these objectives?"

**Part 2: Value Stream Mapping (55 min)**

Map workflows across the 4 value engines:

**Growth Engine Questions:**
- "Walk me through your customer acquisition process from first touch to closed deal"
- "Where do deals get stuck or slow down?"
- "What manual work consumes the most time in sales/marketing?"
- "How do you prioritize leads or opportunities?"

**Retention Engine Questions:**
- "How do you identify customers at risk of churn?"

- "Where do you have the most rework or quality issues?"
- "What reporting or analysis takes the longest to produce?"
- "What manual approvals create bottlenecks?"

**Innovation Engine Questions:**
- "How do you decide what to build next?"
- "How do you measure product adoption or feature usage?"
- "What feedback loops take longest to close?"

**Part 3: Workflow Prioritization (15 min)**

### Play 2.2: AI Readiness Assessment

**Objective:** Assess organizational readiness to implement AI-powered workflows

#### Assessment Framework

Score each workflow (1-5) across 5 dimensions:

**1. Data Availability** (AI leads)
- 1 = No data or data in silos
- 3 = Data exists but requires cleanup
- 5 = Clean, accessible, real-time data

**Questions:** "What data exists for this workflow? Where is it stored? How accessible? How clean/complete? Can we get a sample dataset?"

**2. Technical Infrastructure** (AI leads)
- 1 = Legacy systems, no APIs
- 3 = Modern systems, some integration capability
- 5 = API-first architecture, cloud-native

**Questions:** "What systems are involved? Do they have APIs? What's the integration complexity? Any security/compliance constraints?"

**3. Process Maturity** (BS leads)
- 1 = Ad hoc, tribal knowledge
- 3 = Documented but inconsistent
- 5 = Standardized, optimized, measured

**Questions:** "Is this workflow documented? How consistent is it across teams? Are there SOPs? Who owns it?"

**4. Change Capacity** (TS leads)
- 1 = Change-resistant culture
- 3 = Moderate openness, some resistance
- 5 = Innovation-hungry, early adopter culture

**Questions:** "How receptive are users to new tools? Past adoption successes/failures? Any change fatigue?"

**5. Business Impact Potential** (BS leads)
- 1 = Low frequency, low value
- 3 = Moderate frequency and value
- 5 = High frequency, high strategic value

**Questions:** "How often is this workflow executed? How many people? What's the cost of errors or delays? Strategic importance?"

#### Scoring Process

1. **Individual Scoring** (20 min): Each IA team member scores workflows independently
2. **Calibration** (15 min): Team discusses scores, resolves discrepancies
3. **Composite Score** (10 min): Average scores across 5 dimensions
4. **Ranking** (10 min): Sort workflows by composite readiness score

#### RACI

| Role | Assignment | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| BS | A | Owns overall assessment process |
| AI | R | Leads Data & Tech Infrastructure scoring |
| BS | R | Leads Process Maturity & Business Impact scoring |
| TS | R | Leads Change Capacity scoring |
| CEO, FL | C | Provide data for scoring |

#### Success Criteria

- All 8-12 workflows scored across 5 dimensions
- Team consensus on scores
- Workflows ranked by readiness
- Top 5-7 workflows identified for deeper dive

   - BS scores on 1-5 scale with rationale
   - Capture key gaps and constraints
3. **Heat Map Creation** (20 min):
   - Plot all 9 functions on heat map
   - Identify patterns (e.g., strong product, weak ops)
   - Highlight critical gaps for transformation

#### Key Questions Per Function

**CEO / Strategy:**
- "How often do you review KPIs? What cadence?"
- "Do you have OKRs? Are they measured and tracked?"
- "How data-driven are strategic decisions?"

**Product:**
- "How do you measure product-market fit?"
- "What's your discovery and roadmap process?"
- "How do you track feature adoption?"

**Marketing:**
- "Do you track ROI on marketing spend?"
- "How mature is your attribution model?"
- "What's your MQL to SQL conversion process?"

**Sales:**

3. **Impact × Feasibility Matrix** (20 min)
   - Plot workflows on 2x2 matrix
   - High Impact + High Feasibility = Priority 1
   - Identify "quick wins" and "strategic bets"

#### Prioritization Framework

Score each workflow:

**Impact Score (1-5):**
- Revenue impact
- Cost reduction
- Strategic alignment
- User volume affected

**Feasibility Score (1-5):**
