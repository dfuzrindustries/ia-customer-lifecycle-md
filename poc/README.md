## Purpose

The 30-day Proof of Concept phase takes the 1-3 workflow opportunities identified in your Day 1 Workshop and validates them through working prototypes. This is not a pilot—it's a controlled experiment designed to answer the critical question: **Does this solution deliver measurable business value?**

By the end of 30 days, you will have working prototypes, measured results against success criteria, and a clear go/no-go decision framework for scaling to production.

## Success Criteria

✓ **Measurable Value** — At least 2 of 3 POCs demonstrate quantifiable business value  
✓ **Working Prototypes** — Functional solutions built and tested with real data  
✓ **User Validation** — 5-10 representative users per POC have tested and validated  
✓ **DFVR Assessment** — Complete Desirability, Feasibility, Viability, Responsibility assessment  
✓ **Clear Recommendation** — Data-backed go/no-go decision with business case  
✓ **Executive Presentation** — Findings and next steps presented to sponsor
