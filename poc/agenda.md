# POC: 30-Day Roadmap

**Proof of Concept — Validate, Measure, Decide**

---

**Duration:** 30 days  
**Investment:** $75,000  
**Objective:** Validate 2-3 POCs with measurable results

---

## POC Purpose

The 30-day Proof of Concept phase takes the 1-3 workflow opportunities identified in your Day 1 Workshop and validates them through working prototypes. This is not a pilot—it's a controlled experiment designed to answer the critical question: **Does this solution deliver measurable business value?**

By the end of 30 days, you will have working prototypes, measured results against success criteria, and a clear go/no-go decision framework for scaling to production in the Pilot phase.

---

## ✓ Success Criteria

- **At least 2 of 3 POCs** demonstrate measurable value against pre-defined success metrics
- **Working prototypes** built and tested with real data
- **User validation** from 5-10 representative users per POC
- **Desirability, Feasibility, Viability, Responsibility** assessment completed for each POC
- **Go/No-Go recommendation** with clear business case for Pilot phase
- **Executive presentation** delivered with findings and next steps

- **Day 3-4:** Data validation and sample dataset preparation (anonymized real data)
- **Day 4-5:** Requirements refinement workshops with key stakeholders per POC
- **Day 6-7:** Technical architecture design; user story mapping; sprint planning

**Deliverable:** Technical design document, validated requirements, sprint backlog

---

### Week 2: Build & Iterate (Days 8-14)

**Focus: Prototype Development & Initial Testing**

Build working prototypes with core functionality; begin internal testing with team.

- **Day 8-9:** Core functionality development for all 3 POCs (parallel tracks)
- **Day 10-11:** Integration with existing systems (CRM, HRIS, product analytics, etc.)
- **Day 12:** Internal testing and debugging; refinement based on feedback
- **Day 13:** User interface/experience polish; workflow optimization
- **Day 14:** End-of-week demo to project sponsors; iterate based on feedback

**Deliverable:** Working prototypes (alpha versions), integration documentation, demo recordings

---

### Week 3: User Validation (Days 15-21)

**Focus: Real User Testing & Measurement**

Deploy prototypes to selected users; collect usage data and qualitative feedback.

- **Day 15-16:** User onboarding (5-10 users per POC); training sessions and documentation
- **Day 17-19:** Active user testing period; usage monitoring; support and bug fixes
- **Day 20:** User feedback sessions (1:1 interviews and surveys)
- **Day 21:** Data analysis: usage patterns, time savings, error rates, user satisfaction

**Deliverable:** User feedback report, usage analytics, quantified impact metrics

---

### Week 4: Assessment & Recommendation (Days 22-30)

**Focus: Evaluation & Executive Presentation**

Analyze results, complete DFVR assessment, and deliver go/no-go recommendations.

- **Day 22-23:** DFVR (Desirability, Feasibility, Viability, Responsibility) scoring for each POC
- **Day 24-25:** ROI modeling and business case development for successful POCs
- **Day 26-27:** Executive presentation preparation; recommendations documentation
- **Day 28:** Executive readout: findings, recommendations, Pilot phase proposal
- **Day 29-30:** Documentation finalization; knowledge transfer; Pilot planning initiation

**Deliverable:** Executive presentation, POC assessment report, Pilot phase SOW (for approved POCs)

---

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Working Prototypes

Functional alpha versions of each POC solution with:
- Core functionality implemented
- Integration with existing systems
- User interface for testing
- Documentation and training materials

### 2. User Validation Report

Comprehensive analysis including:
- User feedback synthesis (5-10 users per POC)
- Usage analytics and metrics
- Quantified impact assessment (time saved, errors reduced, etc.)
- Adoption intent and satisfaction scores

### 3. Executive Presentation

Board-ready presentation covering findings, recommendations, and Pilot phase proposal for approved POCs.

### 4. DFVR Assessment

Structured evaluation across four dimensions:
- **Desirability:** User need and adoption intent
- **Feasibility:** Technical viability and integration complexity
- **Viability:** Business case, ROI, and scalability
- **Responsibility:** Ethics, compliance, and risk management

### 5. Go/No-Go Recommendation

Data-backed decision framework with clear business case for each POC, including ROI projections and Pilot phase scoping.

### 6. Pilot Phase SOW

For approved POCs, detailed Statement of Work for 90-day Pilot including scope, timeline, team, and investment.

---

## Go/No-Go Decision Framework

Each POC is evaluated against the DFVR framework to determine next steps:

### Go Criteria (Proceed to Pilot)

- DFVR composite score ≥ 70%
- Positive user feedback (satisfaction score ≥ 7/10)
- Measurable business impact demonstrated
- Technical feasibility confirmed
- Clear ROI projection (payback period < 12 months)

### No-Go Criteria (Do Not Proceed)

- DFVR composite score < 60%
- Negative user feedback or low adoption intent
- No measurable impact or unclear value proposition
- Technical blockers that cannot be resolved in reasonable timeframe
- Compliance or ethical concerns that cannot be mitigated

### Modify & Reassess (Iterate POC)

- DFVR composite score between 60-70%
- Mixed user feedback with clear improvement path
- Some measurable impact but below target
- Technical challenges that can be addressed with additional time/resources

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Access Delays

**Risk:** Client data access restricted or delayed, blocking prototype development.

**Mitigation:**
- Day 1: Finalize data access agreements and permissions
- Use anonymized/synthetic data if real data unavailable
- Parallel track: develop with sample data while waiting for production access

### Scope Creep

**Risk:** Stakeholders request additional features beyond POC scope.

**Mitigation:**
- Day 1: Document and sign off on POC scope and success criteria
- Weekly stakeholder check-ins to manage expectations
- Maintain "future enhancements" backlog for Pilot phase

### User Availability

**Risk:** Target users too busy to participate in testing (Week 3).

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-identify and schedule users during Week 1
- Offer incentives or executive sponsorship for participation
- Keep testing sessions short (30-60 min max)
- Provide flexible testing times

### Technical Integration Challenges

**Risk:** Unexpected complexity in system integration (Week 2).

**Mitigation:**
- Technical discovery during Week 1
- IT stakeholder involvement from Day 1
- Contingency: mock integrations or simplified MVP if needed
- Escalation path to CTO/CIO if blockers arise

---

## What Happens Next

### Transition to Pilot Phase

For POCs that receive "Go" decision:

- Pilot SOW finalized and signed (typically Days 28-30)
- Pilot kickoff scheduled for Day 31-35
- Production environment provisioning begins immediately
- Pilot team assignments confirmed
- User training materials development initiated

### For "No-Go" POCs

- Findings documented for future reference
- Lessons learned captured
- Alternative approaches identified (if any)
- Resources reallocated to approved POCs

### For "Modify & Reassess" POCs

- Additional POC iteration planned (typically +2 weeks)
- Specific improvements identified and scoped
- Re-evaluation criteria defined
- Budget and timeline implications reviewed
